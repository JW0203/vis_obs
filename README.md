A lightweight data visualization project that showcases real-time trends based on Twitter (now X) content.  
Originally developed as part of academic research at Osaka University (2023).

## Background

This visualization is based on research conducted during my Ph.D. coursework in  
Information and Communication Engineering at Osaka University.  
The data analysis and keyword extraction were done separately using Python and Twitter API,  
and the results were exported and visualized using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

## Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- GitHub Pages (for hosting)
